# Hi-Res Redirector

</div>

The Hi-Res Redirector is a browser extension designed to enhance your online visual experience by
automatically redirecting you to higher quality or alternative versions of images on several popular websites.
Whether you're shopping, news browsing, or video watching,
this extension ensures you get the best image quality available.

## Features

- **Amazon**: Auto-redirects Amazon images to their highest resolution counterparts.
- **Adidas**: Ensures you're viewing the crispest product images from Adidas.
- **eBay**: Redirects to high-definition eBay product photos, eliminating blurry item images.
- **BBC**: Enjoy crystal clear visuals when browsing BBC images.
- **More Supported Sites**: Includes support for Marktplaats, Nike, YouTube, AliExpress, and Google User Content, enhancing images across these platforms.

## How It Works

Once activated, the extension monitors the URLs you visit. When it detects you're on one of the supported websites,
it works in the background to modify the image URLs.
If a higher quality or more direct version of the image is found,
it seamlessly redirects you to that image, ensuring optimal image quality without any additional effort.
